# Hybrid runtime campaign: code and remaining work

The CAIRN-301 campaign remains incomplete. Its destination is a Go lifecycle
runtime, a Rust semantic worker and thin host adapters, as described in the
[architecture proposal](hybrid-runtime-consolidation.md) and
[implementation plan](hybrid-runtime-implementation.md).

This source publication makes the reviewed operations tooling inspectable in
the repository. These modules support rollout qualification; the runtime
integration and acceptance milestones remain open.

## Inspect the implementation

Start with [inactive runtime operations](../../integrations/lifecycle/operations/README.md).

| Component | Source | Implemented behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1 topology collector | [collector.py](../../integrations/lifecycle/operations/f1/collector-code/collector.py) | Fixed authenticated reads, route and process metadata checks, bounded child intake and exclusive observation records |
| F1 metadata helper | [metadata_helper.py](../../integrations/lifecycle/operations/f1/helper-code/metadata_helper.py) | Selected socket/process/image checks, exact code closures and the fixed privilege-tool alias chain |
| Effect custody | [effects.py](../../integrations/lifecycle/operations/f3/effects.py) | Exclusive durable intent, fixed actions, causal outcomes and stop uncertainty |
| Local transport | [transport.py](../../integrations/lifecycle/operations/f3/transport.py) | Bounded request/output handling, validated clock samples and retained child custody |
| Handoff sequencing | [sequence.py](../../integrations/lifecycle/operations/f3/sequence.py) | Separate physical join and claim qualification, fresh proof before subsequent effects |
| Journal projection | [journal.py](../../integrations/lifecycle/operations/f3/journal.py) | Bounded structural validation; complete journal collection remains unimplemented |

The F1 entries retain `ENACTED=False`. The F3 entry refuses `REFUSED_UNBOUND`;
its operational launcher and evidence inputs remain unbound. Adding this source
does not wire it into installed services or activate the migration.

## Run the checks

From the repository root, on Linux with Python and Bubblewrap installed:

```sh
make test-hybrid-runtime-operations
```

The target runs 168 F1 tests and 53 F3 tests in isolated namespaces. They use
synthetic observations, fake effects and fixed disposable children. Source is
mounted read-only, with private temporary storage and no production home,
profiles, sockets, network or host process filesystem exposed. These tests
verify the implemented boundaries; live handoff qualification remains separate.

## Remaining work

- Complete the Foundation, semantic IO/native and cross-component integration
  acceptance work tracked by the implementation plan.
- Review exact runtime bindings and source-to-artifact assurance. Machine-bound
  activation drafts and operational evidence are outside this source bundle.
- Implement and review the installation executor, remote launcher/executor,
  complete owner census and controls, host recipe, current clock evidence and
  complete journal collection.
- Qualify installation and live behavior, then finish the supported-host rollout,
  full verification, 24-hour burn-in and retirement of replaced components.

The journal projection still has open cursor-revisit/end-inclusion limits, and
a failed stop-receipt write can propagate `OSError` while the runner remains
stopped. The local operations README records these limits. Publication of the
reviewed source does not close those findings or campaign deployment items.
